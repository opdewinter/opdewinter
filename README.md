- Hi there, I am Olivier de Winter a Cognitive Neuroscience MSc student from the Netherlands. ðŸ§ 
- I live in The Hague and study at the nearby city of Leiden at Leiden University.
  
- For me, studying the brain and mind is a way of unraveling the mysteries of social and individual human life. We all have our very own, unique reality that we create and perceive, and I find studying precisely that very intriguing.
  I delve into topics like emotional processing and affective cognition, psychedelics, consciousness, psychopathology, and more ðŸ‘€
- My perspective is informed by theoretical neuroscience, neuroimaging, neuromodulation, philosophy, and spirituality.

- Besides my studies, I work as a psychology stats teacher at Leiden University and as a research assistant for the psychedelic trials of the Centre for Human Drug Research.
