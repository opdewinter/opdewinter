- Hi there, I am Olivier de Winter a Cognitive Neuroscience MSc student from the Netherlands
- I live in The Hague and study at the nearby city of Leiden at Leiden University.
- Studying the brain and mind is for me a way of unraveling the mysteries of social and individual human life. We all have our very own, unique reality that we perceive and I find studying precisely that very interesting.
  I delve into topics like emotional processing and affective cognition, consciousness, psychopathology, and psychedelics.
- My perspective is informed by theoretical neuroscience, neuroimaging, neuromodulation and philosophy.
- Besides my studies, I work as a psychology stats teacher at Leiden University and as a research assistant for the psychedelic trials at the Centre for Human Drug Research.
